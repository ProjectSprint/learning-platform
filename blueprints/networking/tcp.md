## Overview

An interactive learning experience teaching TCP protocol fundamentals through file transmission simulation. Students learn MTU limitations, TCP handshake, packet sequencing, head-of-line blocking, packet loss detection, and graceful connection teardown.

### Story & Narrative

**Question Title**: "📄 Deliver message.txt"

**Question Description**: "Large files must be split, ordered, and delivered reliably. Build the missing TCP pieces to get message.txt across."

**Initial Terminal Prompt**: "Connection closed. Use the terminal to inspect the exchange."

---

## Learning Objectives

Students will understand:

1. **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)** - Network size limitations requiring file fragmentation
2. **File Fragmentation** - Splitting large files into transmittable packets
3. **TCP Three-Way Handshake** - SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK connection establishment
4. **Sequence Numbers** - Packet numbering for ordering and verification
5. **Head-of-Line Blocking** - Out-of-order packet buffering behavior
6. **Packet Loss** - Network unreliability and packet disappearance
7. **Duplicate ACK Detection** - Using repeated ACKs to detect loss (fast retransmit)
8. **Connection Teardown** - Graceful FIN/FIN-ACK close sequence
9. **Protocol Inspection** - Using terminal commands to analyze network traffic

## Game Configuration

### GridSpace Setup

Three grid spaces represent the data flow pipeline:

| GridSpace ID | Title | Dimensions | Max Items | Initial Visibility | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|------------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| `splitter` | Content Splitter | 1×1 | 1 | Hidden | File fragmentation zone |
| `internet` | Internet | 3×1 | 3 | Visible | Packet transit simulation |
| `server` | Server | 3×4 | 12 | Visible | Data reception & buffering |

**GridSpace Visibility Rules**:
- `splitter`: Hidden initially, revealed after MTU limit modal (phase: mtu → splitter)
- `internet`: Always visible
- `server`: Always visible

### PoolSpace Groups

Four progressive pool groups:

| Group ID | Title | Initial Visibility | Purpose |
|----------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| `files` | Files | Visible | Original files to transmit |
| `split` | Split Packages | Hidden | File fragments (shown after splitting) |
| `tcp-tools` | TCP Tools | Hidden | SYN, ACK, FIN flags (revealed progressively) |
| `received` | Received | Hidden | Server responses (SYN-ACK, ACKs, FIN-ACK) |

**Visibility Triggers**:
- `split`: Shown when file placed in splitter
- `tcp-tools`: Shown when handshake needed
- `received`: Shown when server sends first response

### Item Types

| Type | Icon | Color | Draggable | Allowed Placement | Purpose |
|------|------|-------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| `message-file` | mdi:file-document-outline | #93C5FD (blue) | ✅ | splitter, internet | First file (3 packets) |
| `notes-file` | mdi:file-document-outline | #60A5FA (blue) | ✅ | splitter, internet | Second file (6 packets) |
| `split-packet` | mdi:package-variant | #A3A3A3 → #FACC15 (gray → yellow when sequenced) | ✅ | internet, server | File fragments |
| `syn-flag` | mdi:flag-outline | #FBBF24 (yellow) | ✅ | internet, server | Handshake initiation |
| `syn-ack-flag` | mdi:flag-checkered | #F59E0B (amber) | ❌ | - | Server response (auto-generated) |
| `ack-flag` | mdi:flag | #10B981 (green) | ✅ | internet, server | Handshake completion |
| `fin-flag` | mdi:flag-remove | #F97316 (orange) | ✅ | internet, server | Connection close request |
| `fin-ack-flag` | mdi:flag-remove-outline | #FB923C (orange) | ❌ | - | Close ack (auto-generated) |

**Item Data Schema**:

```typescript
// File items
{
  tcpState: "ready" | "rejected"
}

// Split packets
{
  seq: number,              // 1-6 (packet sequence number)
  seqEnabled: boolean,      // true after handshake completes
  tcpState: "idle" | "in-transit" | "lost" | "buffered" | "received" | "processing" | "rejected",
  fileKey: "message" | "notes"
}

// TCP flags (SYN, ACK, FIN)
{
  tcpState: "idle" | "in-transit" | "delivered" | "received",
  direction?: "server-to-client"  // For server-generated responses
}
```

---

## Phase State Machine

The game uses 11 distinct phases with precise transition rules:

```typescript
type TcpPhase =
  | "mtu"        // Initial: try sending file directly
  | "splitter"   // File rejected, must split
  | "split-send" // Fragment ready, needs connection
  | "syn"        // Must initiate handshake
  | "syn-wait"   // Waiting for SYN-ACK response
  | "ack"        // Must complete handshake
  | "connected"  // Connection active, sending data
  | "notes"      // First file complete, send second
  | "loss"       // Packet loss scenario active
  | "resend"     // Duplicate ACKs detected, waiting for retransmit
  | "closing"    // All data sent, must close connection
  | "terminal"   // Connection closed, terminal available
```

### Detailed Phase Transitions

#### 1. mtu → splitter

**Trigger**: User drags file (message.txt or notes.txt) directly to `internet` space

**Conditions**:

3. Show MTU limit modal (if not shown before)
4. Set phase to `splitter`
5. Reveal `splitter` space (set visible: true)
6. Add file back to pool with status reset

**Side Effects**:
- Modal shown: `mtu-limit` (see Modal System section)
- Server terminal: No change (remains "🔴 Disconnected")

---

#### 2. splitter → split-send

**Trigger**: User drops file onto `splitter` space

**Conditions**:
- Phase is `splitter`
- File item (message-file or notes-file) placed in splitter

**Actions**:

```typescript
for (let seq = 1; seq <= packetCount; seq++) {
  {
    id: `${fileKey}-packet-${seq}`,
    type: 'split-packet',
    name: 'Fragment',
    icon: { kind: 'mdi', name: 'package-variant', color: '#A3A3A3' },

## User Interface Elements

### Contextual Hints

Phase-specific hints guide the user. Display at top of game area.

| Phase | Hint Text |
|-------|-----------|
| `mtu` | "Drag message.txt to the Internet to send it." |
| `splitter` (visible) | "The file is too big. Drop it onto the Content Splitter." |
| `split-send` | "Send a fragment through the Internet and see how the server responds." |
| `syn` | "The server rejected the fragment. Send a SYN to start the handshake." |
| `syn-wait` | "SYN sent. Wait for the SYN-ACK response." |
| `ack` | "SYN-ACK received. Send an ACK to complete the connection." |
| `connected` (no packets sent) | "Send the numbered packets through the Internet." |
| `connected` (packets sent) | "Try sending packets out of order to see them buffered for ordering." |
| `connected` (loss active, waiting) | "The server is waiting for the missing packet. Send it next." |
| `notes` | "notes.txt is ready. Drop it onto the Content Splitter." |
| `loss` | "Send the notes.txt packets through the Internet. Packet #2 will go missing." |
| `resend` | "Duplicate ACKs detected. Resend the missing packet." |
| `closing` | "Send FIN to close the connection cleanly." |
| `terminal` | "Use `tcpdump` in the terminal to inspect the exchange." |

**Special Case**: If connection lost (sequenceEnabled becomes false after being true):
- Override hint: "Connection lost. Re-establish before sending data."

### Server Terminal Messages

Real-time server log displayed in dedicated terminal view. Each message is a terminal entry with type and content.

**Initial State**:
```
> 🔴 Disconnected
```

**Fragment Rejected** (no connection):
```
> Processing...
> I don't understand this package!
```

**SYN Received**:
```
> Processing...
> 🟡 SYN received - sending SYN-ACK...
> 🟡 SYN-ACK sent - waiting for ACK...
```

**ACK Received** (handshake complete):
```
> 🟢 Connected - Waiting for data...
```

**Packet Acknowledged** (dynamic based on buffer state):

When all packets received in order:
```
> Replying with ACK 2, all packets received.
> Replying with ACK 3, all packets received.
```

When packets buffered or missing:
```
> Replying with ACK 2, packet #1 is buffered for ordering.
> Replying with ACK 4, packet #2 is missing; packets #5, #6 are buffered for ordering.
> Replying with ACK 3, packets #4, #5 are buffered for ordering.
```

**File Assembly**:
```
> Processing...
> 📄 message.txt received successfully!
> Waiting for notes.txt packets...
```

```
> Processing...
> 📄 notes.txt received successfully!
```

**Connection Close**:
```
> 🔴 Disconnected
```

**ACK Message Generation Rules**:

1. Find smallest missing sequence number → this is the ACK number
2. List all missing packet numbers
3. List all buffered (waiting) packet numbers
4. Format message:
   - If nothing missing/buffered: "Replying with ACK {N}, all packets received."
   - If missing or buffered: "Replying with ACK {N}, {missing/buffered details}."

**Examples**:
- Received {1}, Waiting {}, Missing {2,3}: "Replying with ACK 2, all packets received."
- Received {1,2}, Waiting {4,5}, Missing {3}: "Replying with ACK 3, packets #4, #5 are buffered for ordering."
- Received {1}, Waiting {3,4}, Missing {2}: "Replying with ACK 2, packets #3, #4 are buffered for ordering."

### Connection Tunnel

Animated visual element appearing between internet and server spacees.

**Visibility**:
- Show when: `connectionActive = true`
- Hide when: `connectionActive = false`

**Appearance**:
- Background: Gray bar (8px height, rounded)
- Foreground: Cyan-to-teal gradient bar
- Animation: Width expands 0% → 100% over 600ms when appearing
- Animation: Opacity fades 100% → 0% over 600ms when disappearing

**Label**: "Connection tunnel" (displayed above bar)

### Receiving Buffer Display

Visual representation of packet buffer state on server.

**Visibility**:
- Show when: `connectionActive = true` OR `receivedCount > 0` OR `waitingCount > 0`
- Hide when: connection never established and no packets received

**Display Format**:

Show buffer slots for all expected sequences (3 for message, 6 for notes):

```
[#1 ✅] [#2 ___] [#3 ⏳] [#4 ___] [#5 ⏳] [#6 ⏳]
```

**Slot States**:
- `✅` = Packet received and processed (in receivedSeqs)
- `⏳` = Packet buffered, waiting for earlier packet (in waitingSeqs)
- `___` = Empty slot, packet not yet arrived

**Update Timing**:
- Updates immediately when sequences change
- Released packets change `⏳` → `✅` with 800ms stagger between each

### Item Status & Labels

Items show dynamic status messages and labels based on state.

#### Status Messages (displayed under item)

**Files** (message-file, notes-file):
- tcpState: `ready` → "Ready"
- tcpState: `rejected` → "Too large"

**Split Packets**:
- tcpState: `idle` → "Ready"
- tcpState: `in-transit` → "Sending..."
- tcpState: `received` → "Received"
- tcpState: `buffered` → "Buffered for ordering"
- tcpState: `lost` → "Lost!"
- tcpState: `processing` → "Processing..."
- tcpState: `rejected` → "Rejected"

**TCP Flags** (SYN, ACK, FIN):
- tcpState: `idle` → "Ready"
- tcpState: `in-transit` → "Sending..."
- tcpState: `received` → "Arrived"

**Server Responses** (SYN-ACK, FIN-ACK):
- In transit: "Receiving"
- Arrived: "ACK Arrived" or "ACK {number} Arrived"

#### Item Labels (item name)

## Business Logic Details

### Packet Flow Simulation

**Pattern**: Watch space for new items → Mark in-transit → Delay → Transfer to next space

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Track previous space item IDs in ref
2. On space change, find new items (not in previous set)
3. For each new item, apply business logic based on type and phase
4. Register all timers for cleanup

**Example - Internet Space**:
- New item detected → Mark as "in-transit"
- After INTERNET_TRAVEL_MS → Transfer to server space
- If item is packet #2 during loss phase → Mark as "lost", remove after LOSS_FADE_MS

### Packet Loss Mechanism

**Fixed Loss**: Packet #2 of notes.txt (6 packets total) is deterministically dropped.

**Control Variables**:
- `lossScenarioRef.current`: boolean, true when notes.txt packets active
- `allowPacket2Ref.current`: boolean, false initially, set true after 3 duplicate ACKs

**Logic**:
```
When item arrives at internet space:
  If item type is split-packet
    AND lossScenarioActive is true
    AND item.seq is 2
    AND allowPacket2 is false:
      → Mark item as "lost" (status: error, tcpState: "lost")
      → Show packet loss modal (once)
      → After LOSS_FADE_MS, remove item from internet
      → Do NOT transfer to server
```

**Retransmit Gate**:
```
When 3 duplicate ACKs detected:
  → Set allowPacket2 to true
  → Highlight packet #2 in pool (red, "Resend?" label)
  → Change phase to "resend"

When packet #2 sent again:
  → allowPacket2 is true, so packet NOT dropped
  → Packet travels normally to server
  → Buffered packets released
```

### Buffer Management

**Head-of-Line Blocking**:

When packet arrives at server, check if it's in sequence:
1. Find smallest missing sequence (expected next)
2. If arriving packet seq > smallest missing:
   - Packet is OUT OF ORDER
   - Add seq to waitingSeqs set
   - Mark item as "buffered" (status: warning, tcpState: "buffered")
   - Show head-of-line blocking modal (once)
   - Do NOT process packet yet
3. If arriving packet seq = smallest missing:
   - Packet is IN ORDER
   - Add seq to receivedSeqs set
   - Mark item as "received" (status: success, tcpState: "received")
   - Process packet immediately
   - Check if buffered packets can now be released

**Buffer Release**:

When in-order packet arrives and closes a gap:
1. Find all consecutive buffered packets starting from next expected seq
2. For each buffered packet, schedule release:
   - Delay: index × BUFFER_STEP_DELAY_MS
   - Action: Move from waitingSeqs to receivedSeqs, update status to "received"
3. Release happens with visual stagger (800ms between each)

**Example**:
- Received: {1}
- Arrives: 3, 4, 5 (out of order)
- Waiting: {3, 4, 5}
- Then arrives: 2 (in order)
- Received: {1, 2}
- Waiting: {3, 4, 5}
- Release sequence:
  - t=0: seq 3 released → Received: {1, 2, 3}
  - t=800ms: seq 4 released → Received: {1, 2, 3, 4}
  - t=1600ms: seq 5 released → Received: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

### Duplicate ACK Detection

**Tracking**:
- `lastAckNumberRef.current`: number | null (last ACK number sent)
- `duplicateAckCountRef.current`: number (consecutive duplicate count)

**Logic**:
```
When server sends ACK:
  If ACK number > total expected packets:
    → Ignore (post-completion ACK)
    → Reset duplicate count to 0
  Else if ACK number = lastAckNumber:
    → Increment duplicate count
  Else:
    → Reset duplicate count to 0

  Update lastAckNumber to current ACK number

  If duplicateAckCount >= 3:
    → Trigger resend phase
    → Show duplicate ACK modal
    → Highlight missing packet
```

**Fast Retransmit**:
- 3 duplicate ACKs = packet loss signal
- Enter "resend" phase
- Enable retransmit gate (allowPacket2 = true)

### ACK Message Generation

**Dynamic Server Messages**:

When server acknowledges packets, message describes buffer state:

```
For each ACK sent:
  1. Determine next expected sequence (smallest not received)
  2. Find missing packets (not received, not waiting)
  3. Find buffered packets (in waiting set)
  4. Generate message:
     - If nothing missing/buffered: "all packets received"
     - If only missing: "packet #{X} is missing"
     - If only buffered: "packets #{X}, #{Y} are buffered for ordering"
     - If both: "packet #{X} is missing; packets #{Y}, #{Z} are buffered for ordering"
```

**Format Examples**:
- `"Replying with ACK 2, all packets received."`
- `"Replying with ACK 3, packet #2 is missing."`
- `"Replying with ACK 2, packets #3, #4 are buffered for ordering."`
- `"Replying with ACK 4, packet #2 is missing; packets #5, #6 are buffered for ordering."`

### State Synchronization

**Problem**: Game state updates are asynchronous, need instant access for logic decisions.

**Solution**: Use refs for instant state + useState for rendering.

**Pattern**:
```typescript
// Instant state (for logic)
const receivedSeqsRef = useRef<Set<number>>(new Set());
const waitingSeqsRef = useRef<Set<number>>(new Set());

// Reactive state (for UI)
const [receivedSeqs, setReceivedSeqs] = useState<number[]>([]);
const [waitingSeqs, setWaitingSeqs] = useState<number[]>([]);

// Sync function
const syncBufferState = () => {
  setReceivedSeqs(Array.from(receivedSeqsRef.current));
  setWaitingSeqs(Array.from(waitingSeqsRef.current));
};

// Update pattern
receivedSeqsRef.current.add(seq);  // Instant
syncBufferState();                  // Trigger re-render
```

### Timer Registry

**Problem**: Component unmount while timers active causes memory leaks and errors.

**Solution**: Register all timers, clean up on unmount.

**Pattern**:
```typescript
const timersRef = useRef<Set<ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>>>(new Set());

const registerTimer = (timerId: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>) => {
  timersRef.current.add(timerId);
};

// When creating timer
const timer = setTimeout(() => { ... }, delay);
registerTimer(timer);

// Cleanup on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    for (const timerId of timersRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(timerId);
    }
    timersRef.current.clear();
  };
}, []);
```

### Item Tracking

**Problem**: Need to find item's current location across multiple spaces.

**Solution**: Search all spaces, return location + item.

**Pattern**:
```typescript
const findItemLocationLatest = (itemId: string) => {
  for (const [spaceKey, space] of Object.entries(spacesRef.current)) {
    const item = space.placedItems.find(i => i.id === itemId);
    if (item) {
      return { spaceId: spaceKey, item };
    }
  }
  return null;
};
```

### Conditional Updates

**Problem**: Dispatching identical updates causes unnecessary re-renders.

**Solution**: Check if update actually changes item before dispatching.

**Pattern**:
```typescript
const updateItemIfNeeded = (
  item: PlacedItem,
  spaceId: string,
  updates: { status?: string; [key: string]: unknown }
) => {
  let needsUpdate = false;

  // Check status change
  if (updates.status && updates.status !== item.status) {
    needsUpdate = true;
  }

  // Check data changes
  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(updates)) {
    if (key === 'status') continue;
    if (item.data?.[key] !== value) {
      needsUpdate = true;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (!needsUpdate) return;

  dispatch({
    type: 'CONFIGURE_DEVICE',
    payload: {
      deviceId: item.id,
      puzzleId: spaceId,
      config: updates
    }
  });
};
```

### Previous State Detection

**Problem**: Need to detect NEW items placed on space (not existing items).

**Solution**: Track previous item IDs, compare with current.

**Pattern**:
```typescript
const prevInternetIdsRef = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set());

useEffect(() => {
  const currentIds = new Set(internetSpace.placedItems.map(i => i.id));

  // Find new items (in current but not in previous)
  const newItems = internetSpace.placedItems.filter(
    item => !prevInternetIdsRef.current.has(item.id)
  );

  // Process new items
  for (const item of newItems) {
    handleNewItemOnInternet(item);
  }

  // Update previous for next comparison
  prevInternetIdsRef.current = currentIds;
}, [internetSpace.placedItems]);
```

### Modal Deduplication

**Problem**: Same modal can be triggered multiple times.

**Solution**: Track shown modals in ref, check before showing.

**Pattern**:
```typescript
const modalShownRef = useRef({
  mtu: false,
  synIntro: false,
  holBlocking: false,
  packetLoss: false,
  // ... all modals
});

// Before showing modal
if (!modalShownRef.current.mtu) {
  modalShownRef.current.mtu = true;
  dispatch({ type: 'OPEN_MODAL', payload: buildMtuModal() });
}
```

## Visual Feedback

### Connection Tunnel Animation

**Element**: Horizontal bar between internet and server

**States**:
- Hidden: Connection not established
- Appearing: Width animates 0% → 100% over 600ms (cubic-bezier easing)
- Visible: Full width, gradient background
- Disappearing: Opacity fades 100% → 0% over 600ms

**Gradient**: Linear gradient from cyan (#06B6D4) to teal (#14B8A6)

**Label**: "Connection tunnel" displayed above bar

**Triggers**:
- Show: connectionActive changes false → true
- Hide: connectionActive changes true → false

### Buffer Display Updates

**Real-time Updates**: Buffer display reflects current receivedSeqs and waitingSeqs state.

**Visual States**:
- Empty slot: Gray text `[#N ___]`
- Buffered slot: Yellow text `[#N ⏳]`
- Received slot: Green text `[#N ✅]`

**Update Animation**: When buffered packet releases, emoji changes ⏳ → ✅ with 800ms stagger between packets.

### Item Status Colors

Items use game engine status field for visual indication:

| Status | Visual Effect | Used For |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| `normal` | Default appearance | Idle items |
| `success` | Green highlight | Received packets |
| `warning` | Yellow/orange highlight | In-transit, buffered items |
| `error` | Red highlight | Lost packets, rejected items |

### Server Status Display

**Location**: Above server space

**Content**: Current server log last entry (or status message)

**Color Coding**:
- 🔴 Red: Disconnected
- 🟡 Yellow: Handshaking (SYN received, SYN-ACK sent, waiting for ACK)
- 🟢 Green: Connected

**Examples**:
- "🔴 Disconnected"
- "🟡 SYN-ACK sent - waiting for ACK..."
- "🟢 Connected - Waiting for data..."
- "Replying with ACK 3, all packets received."
- "📄 message.txt received successfully!"

## Testing Scenarios

### Happy Path (Perfect Execution)

1. Drag message.txt to internet → MTU modal, splitter appears
2. Drag message.txt to splitter → 3 packets created
3. Drag packet #1 to internet → Server rejects, SYN modal, SYN appears
4. Drag SYN to internet → SYN-ACK arrives, ACK modal, ACK appears
5. Drag ACK to internet → Handshake complete modal, connection active, packets numbered
6. Drag packet #1 to internet → Travels, arrives, ACK received
7. Drag packet #2 to internet → Travels, arrives, ACK received
8. Drag packet #3 to internet → Travels, arrives, ACK received, message.txt assembled
9. Drag notes.txt to splitter → 6 packets created, loss scenario active
10. Drag packet #1 to internet → Arrives, ACK sent
11. Drag packet #2 to internet → **LOST**, packet loss modal
12. Drag packet #3 to internet → Buffered (HOL blocking modal), duplicate ACK #2
13. Drag packet #4 to internet → Buffered, duplicate ACK #2
14. Drag packet #5 to internet → Buffered, duplicate ACK #2, resend phase triggered
15. Drag packet #2 again → Travels (not lost), arrives, buffer releases
16. Drag packet #6 to internet → Arrives, notes.txt assembled, close modal, FIN appears
17. Drag FIN to internet → FIN-ACK exchange, connection closes
18. Type `tcpdump` in terminal → Full log displayed, success modal, question complete

### Edge Case 1: Out-of-Order Delivery (Message Phase)

1. Complete handshake normally
2. Drag packet #3 first → Buffered, HOL modal, ACK #1 sent
3. Drag packet #1 → Received, ACK #2 sent, packet #3 released, ACK #4 sent
4. Drag packet #2 → Received, message.txt assembled

**Expected**: Buffer display shows `[#1 ___] [#2 ___] [#3 ⏳]` then releases when #1 arrives.

### Edge Case 2: Sending Data Before Handshake

1. Drag message.txt to splitter → 3 packets
2. Drag packet #1 to internet (before handshake) → Server rejects
3. Server log: "Processing..." then "I don't understand this package!"
4. SYN intro modal appears

**Expected**: Data rejected until connection established.

### Edge Case 3: Multiple Out-of-Order (Notes Phase)

1. Complete message.txt transfer
2. Split notes.txt → 6 packets
3. Send packets: #1, #3, #4, #5, #6 (skip #2 intentionally)
4. Packets #3, #4, #5, #6 all buffered
5. Duplicate ACKs accumulate (3 × ACK #2)
6. Resend modal shown
7. Send #2 → All buffered packets release in sequence

**Expected**: Buffer shows `[#1 ✅] [#2 ___] [#3 ⏳] [#4 ⏳] [#5 ⏳] [#6 ⏳]`, then releases with stagger.

### Edge Case 4: Early Resend Attempt (Before 3 Duplicates)

1. Packet #2 lost, packets #3, #4 sent (buffered)
2. Duplicate ACK count = 2 (not yet 3)
3. User tries to resend #2 before 3rd duplicate ACK

**Expected**: Packet still gets lost (allowPacket2 still false), loss happens again, duplicate count continues.

### Edge Case 5: Terminal Commands Before Phase

1. During mtu or connected phase, try typing `tcpdump`

**Expected**: "Error: Terminal is not ready yet."

### Edge Case 6: Unknown Commands

1. In terminal phase, type `ls`

**Expected**: "Unknown command: ls. Type 'help' for available commands."
