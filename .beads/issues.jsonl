This violated the single responsibility principle - a canvas component shouldn't know about specific item types or business-level modal decisions.\n\n2. **Native HTML5 DragEvent usage**: Both InventoryPanel and PlayCanvas used native HTML5 drag-and-drop API (`draggable` attribute, `DragEvent`, `dataTransfer`). This approach lacks the smooth momentum-based dragging and snap-to-grid functionality that GSAP Draggable provides.\n\n### Fixes Applied\n\n#### 1. Made PlayCanvas business-logic agnostic\n- Added `onPlacedItemClick` and `isItemClickable` props to PlayCanvas\n- Removed hardcoded item type checks (\"router\", \"pc\") from the component\n- Moved modal-opening logic to the question-specific page component (`-page.tsx`)\n- PlayCanvas now delegates click behavior to parent via callbacks\n\n#### 2. Created shared drag coordination system\n- **drag-types.ts**: Defines shared `DragData`, `DragSource`, and `ActiveDrag` types\n- **drag-context.tsx**: React context with `DragProvider` and `useDragContext` hook for cross-component drag coordination\n\n#### 3. Enhanced gsap-drag.ts utilities\n- Added `GridMetrics` type for grid configuration\n- Added `GridDraggableConfig` type and `createGridDraggable` function with:\n  - Grid snap configuration\n  - Inertia/momentum support\n  - liveSnap for snapping while dragging\n  - edgeResistance for smooth bounds behavior\n  - minimumMovement to distinguish click from drag\n- Added `convertPixelToBlock` and `convertBlockToPixel` helper functions\n\n#### 4. Refactored PlayCanvas to use GSAP Draggable\n- Replaced native DragEvent handlers with GSAP Draggable instances\n- Each placed item now has a Draggable attached for repositioning\n- Uses liveSnap for grid-snapping during drag\n- Inertia enabled for momentum-based motion after release\n- Click detection via GSAP's onClick (with minimumMovement: 4)\n- Drag preview shows valid/invalid placement in real-time\n\n#### 5. Refactored InventoryPanel to use GSAP Draggable\n- Replaced native `draggable` and drag event handlers\n- Uses DragContext to communicate active drag to PlayCanvas\n- Each inventory item has a GSAP Draggable instance\n- Items reset position on drag end (snap back)\n\n#### 6. Updated GameLayout and page components\n- GameLayout now wraps children with DragProvider\n- Added click handler props passthrough\n- Networking page now handles its own modal-opening logic\n\n### Key Benefits\n- **Performance**: GSAP Draggable is GPU-accelerated with optimized rendering\n- **Usability**: Smooth momentum-based dragging with inertia\n- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns - canvas doesn't know about business types\n- **Scalability**: Easy to add new item types without modifying PlayCanvas\n- **Reliability**: Consistent drag behavior with proper snap-to-grid\n\n### Files Changed\n- src/components/game/drag-types.ts (new)\n- src/components/game/drag-context.tsx (new)\n- src/components/game/gsap-drag.ts (enhanced)\n- src/components/game/play-canvas.tsx (refactored)\n- src/components/game/inventory-panel.tsx (refactored)\n- src/components/game/game-layout.tsx (updated)\n- src/routes/questions/networking/-page.tsx (updated)","created_at":"2026-01-17T02:35:04Z"}]}
